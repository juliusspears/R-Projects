# Student Traits and Exam Scores
Student traits play a critical role in shaping a studentâ€™s academic performance. In this project, I seek to
provide insight into the strength and effect of specific traits on academic progress. This project utilizes
simulated data based off of real-world trends of student habits across diverse populations. It consists of a
sample of 1,000 student records, including traits such as study hours, sleep hours, diet, social media hours,
and mental health ratings.

This project has a folder for the final results, R-scripts, raw data, R-markdown files, and plots.
